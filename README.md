## CyDRA: Risk Assessment in Transactions under Security Threats


#### Project Structure
The CyDRA platform consists of two separate servers:

- Backend Server (Flask-based) – Handles data processing and API requests.
- Frontend Server (React & TypeScript) – Manages the user interface and interactions.

Both servers must be running simultaneously for the platform to function properly.
You can find setup and execution instructions for each in their respective README.md files inside the [backend](./backend/) and [frontend](./frontend/) folders.
